#### Description: Matlab code of distance distributions used in paper "Meta Distribution Analysis of the Downlink SIR for the Typical Cell in a Poisson Cellular Network".  This code approximates the distributions of distances Rn of n-th nearest BS from the typical user of the Type I user point process [1].  Use ''
