#### Description: Matlab code for the distance distributions used in paper "Meta Distribution Analysis of the Downlink SIR for the Typical Cell in a Poisson Cellular Network".  This code approximates the distributions of distances Rn of n-th nearest BS from the typical user of the Type I user point process [1].  The apporximated closed form expression for the distribution of Rn is 1-exp(-pi lambda rho_n r^2) where rho_n is the correction factor. Use 'Main.m' to verify the approximated distribution of Rn and to obtained the correction factors rho_n.
